# Bisection
Bisection is a numerical method used to find roots of a function. It works by repeatedly dividing an interval that contains a root in half and then selecting the subinterval in which the function changes sign, which must contain a root according to the intermediate value theorem.

Inputs needed:

The function you want to find the root of
The interval that contains the root (specified by endpoints a and b)
The stopping criteria

Outputs produced:

An estimate of the root of the function within the given interval that satisfies the specified criteria.

This algorithm can be used to solve for the root of the given function. It can be used to find the root of the function f(x) = x^3 - 2x - 5 within the interval [2, 3]. We use the bisection method to find a value of x that makes f(x) equal to zero within this interval.
