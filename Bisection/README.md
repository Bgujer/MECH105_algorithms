# Bisection
Bisection is a numerical method used to find roots of a function (i.e., values of x for which f(x) = 0). It works by repeatedly dividing an interval that contains a root in half and then selecting the subinterval in which the function changes sign, which must contain a root according to the intermediate value theorem.
