This file computes photodegradation of aqueous bromide where c is the concentration in ppm (parts per million), and t is the time in minutes.

This MATLAB file creates a plot displaying both the measured experimental data (using red diamond shapes) and the expected function (using a green dashed line). 
Plot the function for the first 70 minutes, using one point every 30 seconds (including the beggining and end point).
