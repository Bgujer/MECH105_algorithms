This script computes linear regression and puts it into slope-intercept format.
Inputs: 
x-values of the data set
y-values of the data set
Outputs:
Filtered x-values (i.e. the input x-values but without the outlier points), sorted from smallest to largest
Filtered y-valeus (i.e. the input y-values but without the outlier points), sorted from smallest to largest
Slope from the linear regression (m in )
Intercept from the linear regression (b in )
Rsquared value
