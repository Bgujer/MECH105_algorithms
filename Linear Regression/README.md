# Linear Regression
This script computes linear regression and puts it into slope-intercept format.

Inputs: 
- x-values of the data set
- y-values of the data set

Outputs:
- Filtered x-values (i.e. the input x-values but without the outlier points), sorted from smallest to largest
- Filtered y-valeus (i.e. the input y-values but without the outlier points), sorted from smallest to largest
- Slope from the linear regression (m )
- Intercept from the linear regression (b)
- Rsquared value

As long as you have two equal length arrays, this algorithm will be able to fit a line to it.
