The tank in a water tower has the geometry shown in the figure (the lower part is a cylinder and the upper part is an inverted frustum of a cone). Inside the tank there is a float that indicates the level of the water. Write a MATLAB program that determines the volume of the water in the tank from the position (height h) of the float.
